Set the server ip of the mqtt server of homeassistant (usually the same ip as your homeassistant).
Choose any device name for the device (default: cz2020) and optionally change the [discovery prefix](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/#discovery_prefix).

## Startup sequence
On startup, all keys turn red. The first row turns orange when starting connect to wifi, and to green if wifi connection was successful.
The second row turns orange when connecting to the mqtt server, and to green if connected successful.
